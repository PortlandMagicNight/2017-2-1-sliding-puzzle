This months PDX magic might will be to create and implement a [sliding
puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

Constraints:

- The puzzle must be playable from keyboard input.
- The program will generate a puzzle in a random configuration and the puzzle
  generated must be __solvable__.
  - You may create either the 8-puzzle or the 15-puzzle.
  - You may include a mode that will automatically solve the puzzle or present
    a hint.

Outside of these constraints you may implement it as text based or any graphical
way you choose.
